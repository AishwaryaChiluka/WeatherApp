# WeatherApp

I have used MVVM architecture pattern with rxjava , Retrofit & Dagger 

In the given url https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CityName}&appid=a567eca4b52f20847650b5f73af13af9

APIKEY was not working  so I have used other APIKEY as 02f21410a8f10fe0dbbef5f368f26422

To handle error i have used generic class an snackbr todisplay error 

1)for incorrect api I have used snackbar showing pleas use valid key

2)for unknown exception it shows something went wrong 

3) for others it shows error details
